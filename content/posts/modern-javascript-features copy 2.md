# Modern JavaScript Features You Should Know

JavaScript has evolved significantly over the years. Here are some modern features that can make your code more concise, readable, and powerful.

## Destructuring Assignment

Destructuring allows you to extract values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.

```javascript
// Object destructuring
const person = { name: 'John', age: 30, job: 'Developer' };
const { name, age } = person;
console.log(name); // 'John'

// Array destructuring
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
const [firstColor, secondColor] = colors;
console.log(firstColor); // 'red'
```

## Spread and Rest Operators

These operators make working with arrays and objects much more convenient.

### Spread Operator

- **Array Spreading**: Expand an array into individual elements
- **Object Spreading**: Copy properties from one object to another

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const newNumbers = [...numbers, 4, 5]; // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const userDetails = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };
const userWithRole = { ...userDetails, role: 'Admin' };
```

## Optional Chaining

Optional chaining `?.` allows you to access deeply nested object properties without worrying about whether the property exists.

## Nullish Coalescing

The nullish coalescing operator `??` provides a way to specify a default value when dealing with `null` or `undefined` values.

```javascript
const value = null;
const defaultValue = value ?? 'Default';
console.log(defaultValue); // 'Default'
```

These modern JavaScript features can significantly improve your development experience and code quality. Start incorporating them into your projects today!
